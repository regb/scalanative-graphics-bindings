Graphics Bindings for Scala Native
==================================

This repository hosts bindings to the popular graphics programming
libraries SDL2 and OpenGL. The bindings try as much as possible to
mimick the original programming interface in C. In particular, they
won't hide scalanative interoperability types behind regular Scala
types.

To get started, you can have a look at the `examples` foldes, containing
runnable demo projects.

The bindings are still work in progress.
